# Wiki-to-Philsosophy
A console application that will record the path from any given wikipedia page to the wikipedia philosophy page by clicking the first link*

Clicking the first link in the main text of a wikipedia article will almost always lead to philosophy.

This program uses a webcrawler that visually outputs the list, path, and number of links clicked to get from any wikipedia article to Philosophy.
